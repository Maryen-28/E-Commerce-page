# ShopHub 🛒

A modern **e-commerce / user-role based web application** allowing customers, staff, admin, and delivery riders to sign in and interact with the system.

## 🚀 What is ShopHub

ShopHub is a full-featured e-commerce landing + user management application built with modern web technologies.  
It supports multiple types of users (Customer, Staff, Admin, Delivery Rider), with role-specific login and workflows.  
The UI includes authentication (login/signup), user-role selection, and a clean storefront / account dashboard as a starting template for extending into a full commerce platform.

- Signup / Login form with demo credentials for quick access  
- Clean UI / UX for user login and registration

> *You can expand this README to include more features as you build them: product listing, cart, checkout, order history, admin panel, delivery tracking, etc.*
